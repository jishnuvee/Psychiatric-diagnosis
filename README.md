# Psychiatric-diagnosis

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jishnuvee/Psychiatric-diagnosis) for this project

This project investigates the relationship between EEG brainwave activity and psychiatric conditions, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. After cleaning the data and narrowing the focus to key demographic and cognitive features, I explored how delta power in the frontal lobe (FP1 and FP2 electrodes) correlates with different psychiatric diagnoses. Visualization and exploratory analysis revealed that individuals with schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder tend to exhibit unusually high delta power, suggesting potential neural slowing. However, significant overlap across disorders indicates that delta power alone is insufficient for accurate classification.
